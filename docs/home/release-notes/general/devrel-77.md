# Esper Console Release notes 77

Date: 2/21/2022

  

Esper DevRel 77 is a minor release with essential updates. We've improved the app start time and added the new payment feature for new sign-ups. You can find the complete breakdown of what’s new below.
  
## Optimization of App start time
    
We have optimized the launch time of the Esper Agent App on the device to provide a better user experience. This will help resolve the delay in the password violation screen and allow a quick switch between multi-app and kiosk mode.

  
We’re excited to launch DevRel 77 today, and the Esper team is hard at work on DevRel 78, which is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of March 2021. Please [reach out](https://support.esper.io/s/) to share your thoughts on how Esper can improve future releases.
