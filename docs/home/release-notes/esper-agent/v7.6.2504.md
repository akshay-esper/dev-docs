Welcome to the Esper Agent release notes. We believe that you will like the updates in this version. Some key highlights are:  
  
What’s New-  

- You can enroll in a range of possible Wi-Fi access points based on the rule determined by a Regular Expression (RegEx) Once the RegEx is added, we try to connect to the strongest network. Please contact [Esper support](https://support.esper.io/s/) to know more about this feature.  

- For Android 8 and above, if the password is set to NONE in the compliance policy, we are clearing any passwords set on the device, so the device will not prompt for an unlock screen.  
  
Bugs and Improvements-  

- We have added an option to control application installations via Esper console based on the Cellular or Wi-Fi connection. This is a premium feature. Please reach out to the Esper team to learn more.  

- We have improved the WIPE command; the device will now be wiped in a window of 24 to 36 hrs.  
  
And that’s it for this release. Watch out for more exciting updates in future releases. If you have any questions or need help, don’t hesitate to contact Esper.
