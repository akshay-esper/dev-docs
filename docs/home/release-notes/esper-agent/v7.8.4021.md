Welcome to the Esper Agent release notes. We believe that you will like the updates in this version. Some key highlights are:  
  
What’s New-  

- We have optimized the time between the launch of the Esper Agent App and the display of the first screen on the device to provide a better user experience. This will help resolve the delay in the password violation screen and allow a quick switch between multi-app and kiosk mode.  
  
And that’s it for this release. Watch out for more exciting updates in future releases. If you have any questions or need help, don’t hesitate to contact Esper.
