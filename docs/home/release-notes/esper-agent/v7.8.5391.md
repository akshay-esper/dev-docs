# Esper Agent Release Notes 

Date: 4/14/2022

Version: v7.8.5391  


DevRel: 81

Bugs and Improvements-

- We fixed the issue where the preloaded app state- SHOW, HIDE, and DISABLE did not change in the device when there was no blueprint applied during provisioning.

- We fixed the kiosk app launch issue occurring in certain devices when the older Esper agent version is upgrading to the newer Esper agent version.

And that’s it for this release. Watch out for more exciting updates in future releases. If you have any questions or need help, don’t hesitate to contact Esper.
