DevRel: 86 

Welcome to the Esper Agent release notes. We believe that you will like the updates in this version. Some key highlights are:  

Bugs and Improvements:

-   When a blueprint is applied to a device, changes made to the applications section in the blueprint now reflect on the device. All apps will be removed, updated/downgraded, installed, or hidden/shown to match the new blueprint state.
    
-   We have added an API for scheduled power ON/OFF for specific Lenovo devices. Please contact [Esper Support](https://support.esper.io/s/) to know more about this feature.
    
-   A Network Fallback Reboot message is shown in the event feed if the device turns off in the NoNetworkFallback scenario.
    
  
And that’s it for this release. Watch out for more exciting updates in future releases. If you have any questions or need help, please don’t hesitate to contact [Esper Support](https://support.esper.io/s/). We’d love to hear from you.
