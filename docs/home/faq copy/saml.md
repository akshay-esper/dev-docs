# SAML/SSO

## Will all my users be required to sign in via SAML SSO (my IdP) when this is set up?

 Yes, once you configure the SAML SSO configuration, all users will be routed to sign-in via your own IdP.

  

## Can anyone update the SAML SSO configuration in Esper?

 No, only Enterprise Admins are able to enable/disable the SAML SSO configuration.
